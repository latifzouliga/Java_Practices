switch statement:
         In new version of java we can write switch statement by getting red of break statement
         and : colon and replacing them with token error.
         Another way of writing switch statement is to get rid of break statement and replacing it with yield

Var:
         also called LVTI: local variable type inference
         it only works with local variables
         it looks like dynamic typing but IT IS NOT
         for var it is must to initialize

Sealed classes:
         In Java, we have:
         Abstract class the is meant to be inherited,
         Final class that is not meant to be inherited
         What if we want something in between, a class that can be inherited but only can inherit from a specific classes
         In this situation sealed class comes handy

Record class:
         Record class is immutable class, which means that its objects values can not be changed once they are set
         Record class is class that has Constructor, getter methods, equals and hashcode methods, and toString method
         A good usage of record class could be a DTO, data transfer object

Text Clock:
         A new way of writing multiple sting lines in a nice formatted way by using """""" triple double colon

String template:
         String template can be helpful when doing string concatenation with different datatype
